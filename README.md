# API for cancer patients
To store our data, we used the PostgreSQL database and integrated key security features such as token-based authentication, input sanitation, anti-proxy servers, as well as Cross-Origin Resource Sharing to prevent any malicious attacks or abuse. Then we created a Flask/Golang Rest API to allow easy and secure communication between our front end and back end frameworks.
